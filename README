Project about Hardware Locks for "Advanced Multiprocessor Programming", summer term 2023 at TU WIEN. 

# Usage

Compilation and execution is done with the following commands:

### Correctness:

```sh
$ make correctnessTest lock=... thread_number=... array_size=...
```
e.g.:
```sh
$ make correctnessTest lock=TicketLock thread_number=30 array_size=10000
```

### Benchmarks:

```sh
$ make fairness lock=... thread_number=... reps=... acquisitions=...
```
```sh
$ make throughput lock=...
```
```sh
$ make latency lock=...
```
e.g.:
```sh
$ make fairness lock=TestAndSet thread_number=20 reps=10 acquisitions=10000
```
